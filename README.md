# Neighborhood Map Project: Seattle's Coffee

This single-page app is a map of my favorite coffee shops in Seattle area.
Choose any coffee shop on the map or sidebar to see information about the spot.
This information includes:
- title, description, milk options and coordinates (from local json object)
- rating, review count, pricing and image (from Yelp servers via Yelp Fusion)

Map representation implemented via Google Maps API.

## Main feature
For all the non-dairy milk lovers there is an awesome feature -
you can filter coffee shops by your favorite non-dairy milk option!
Use "filter" button to see the list of options and choose any milk you like.
Now you should see only coffee shops with you favorite milk available -
both on the map and in the sidebar.
